The general design rationale is:
- Split each algorithm to a separate header
- Make each algorithm as general as possible, so its use is versatile
- Each algorithm holds references to objects it needs, so a pipeline execution is possible
- Each algorithm is executed with a call to apply()
- Naming conventions: Data-storing classes are labeled as nouns, algorithm classes as verbs to emphasise them doing somehting.
